			<p id="startPara">Kamusta! <br><br>I am Ryan Peralta, 22 years old and I am currently studying Landscape Architecture in Victoria University of Wellington. I was born and raised in the Philippines and my family and I moved to Whanganui, New Zealand in 2009 to have better life opportunities. I always find giving back to people who have helped me throughout my life motivating. Especially coming from a poorer country, I have had first hand experiences of seeing how difficult life can be sometimes and fortunately enough after moving to New Zealand, I was able to pursue my passion for landscape architecture, with the help of my family. Also, the Whanganui Catholic church community has become a second family to my family.</p>

			<p>After living in New Zealand for eleven years I have seen a great amount of differences between the mindset of the society here in New Zealand and in the Philippines, with religion and churches. I found a great opportunity to contribute back, at a local level, to the catholic church community of Whanganui on how we can create space which we can all share and can be utilized throughout the day.</p>
