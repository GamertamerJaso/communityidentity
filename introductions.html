			<h2>Introductions</h2>
			<p>After living in New Zealand for eleven years I have seen a great amount of differences between the mindset of the society here in New Zealand and in the Philippines, about religion and churches. In the Philippines churches are considered an important and respected building within the society, due to the popularity of religion, especially Catholicism. People would want to be closer to the  &#39;house of God&#39; on their day-to-day living.
			<br><br>
			Street vendors would typically be located close to the church, families would visit the church throughout the day, outdoor seating areas would be filled by people who work close by or live close by when they are on their break. Therefore, the outdoor spaces of churches are well utilized by the surrounding community. </p>
